# Readme

This is a firs development task submitted via Utopian.io  
Fix and optimize web page by removing current issues.
Total rework is appreciated but not necessary. The main goal of optimization is to make index.html readable and editable, as the page is mutable at current stage. It would be very handy to get a comments on how to use further block constructor.

Current major issues:

1. Sticky header not working in online version.  
2. h5 sub-header "research and development" in utopia2 content block displayed as oversized in online version.  
3. Image GAME_logo.png does not loading from server but work in offline mode for some unknown reason.  
4. Image world.png does not stretch from border to border in "morgave content-bock"  
5. Gif animation SIS.gif is not on top of world.png  
6. Gif animation HIS.gif is offset and needs to be stretched to fit the screen and be seamless with world.png  
7. Realize text wrapping around the gifs in "hinessa content-bock"  
8. Implement borderless video streaming from vimeo in video content-bock  
9. Flexible footer with right sized icons and the ability to add more icons in the row.
